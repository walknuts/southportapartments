Grady are also your contact for:

- Reporting lost keys and fobs (so the latter can be de-activated)
- Ordering new keys and fobs (not available from Bunnings or general locksmiths).

Note: A recent audit identified a problem with the ‘Lodge a Ticket’ QR code, which Grady are investigating. If you can’t lodge a ticket, or if Grady don’t respond ‘within 1 business day’, as promised, please let us know
at our EC email address below.

## Building Manager

Here’s our Building Manager, Paul Hattersley, so you’ll recognise him when you see him around: ![](./attachments/8-CONTACT-attachment-003.jpg)

## Can I contact the Executive Committee (EC) directly?

The Strata Manager should be your primary contact. However, contact us directly if you are not satisfied. Renters, please contact us through your landlord or their agent.

Our email address is: ec@southport.apartments

Please be patient if we do not answer immediately. We are volunteers who only meet monthly.
