## LEGISLATION

Some ACT Acts and Regulations governing Southport are:

- [_Unit Titles (Management) Act 2011 (ACT)_](https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/View/a/2011-41/current/html/2011-41.html)
- [_Unit Titles (Management) Regulation 2011 (ACT_](https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/View/sl/2011-39/current/html/2011-39.html)
- [_Unit Titles Act 2001_](https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/View/a/2001-16/current/html/2001-16.html)
- [_Land Titles Act 1925_](https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/View/a/1925-1/current/html/1925-1.html)

## STANDARDS

Some standards are:

- [National Construction Code (NCC)](https://ncc.abcb.gov.au)
- [Australian Standards](https://www.standards.org.au)

### NCC applicability

Southport's buildings are Class 2, so the applicable NCC volumes are Volume 1 (from the old Building Code of Australia) and Volume 3 for plumbing.

## DEFINITIONS

Managing Southport involves knowing some definitions. The following definitions summarise the full legal and authoritative definitions in the referenced legislation.

### Units plan

A legal group of units. Southport is registered as Units Plan No. 4368.

See the [_Unit Titles Act 2001_](https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/View/a/2001-16/current/html/2001-16.html), dictionary.

### Developer

A lessee who applies to develop a units plan on their land. Southport’s developer was GEOCON.

See the [_Unit Titles Act 2001_](https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/View/a/2001-16/current/html/2001-16.html), dictionary.

### Owners corporation

A corporation of unit owners responsible for managing their units plan. Some Australian states call it a ‘body corporate’.

See the [_Unit Titles (Management) Act 2011 (ACT)_](https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/View/a/2011-41/current/html/2011-41.html), sections 7 and 10.

### Strata

A units plan’s finances, people and legals. It’s like the _software_.

### Facilities

A units plan’s buildings, equipment and systems. It’s like the _hardware_.

### Unit ‘type’

Southport’s units are Class A because ‘the boundary of the unit is defined by floors, walls and ceilings of the unit’ (from [ACT Planning’s website](https://www.planning.act.gov.au/community/buy/leasing-and-titles/unit-titles)).

While mainly residential, Southport is what the [_Unit Titles (Management) Act 2011 (ACT)_](https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/View/a/2011-41/current/html/2011-41.html), in s 39A, calls a ‘mixed-use inputs plan’.

## STRATA MANAGEMENT

While s 7 of the [_Unit Titles (Management) Act 2011 (ACT)_](https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/View/a/2011-41/current/html/2011-41.html) says ‘The owners corporation for a units plan is responsible for managing the units plan’, it also says, ‘An owners corporation may be helped by … a manager’, often called a Strata Manager.

## SOUTHPORT APARTMENTS POLICIES

The purposes of our policies are:

- To consider and specify our goals
- To guide the Strata Manager’s operational management, including answering owners’ enquiries, without them having to ask the Executive Committee each time
- Standardisation across Executive Committees.

Policies are essential for quality management, the ideal being an [ISO 9001-approved Quality Manual](https://www.iso.org/standard/62085.html).
