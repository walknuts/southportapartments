There, you will find the resident’s intercom and mailbox.

### Units 354 to 356

These are our shops on Anketell Street:

- 354 is O Bach

### Deliveries

If the resident does not answer and your delivery has an Authority to Leave (ATL), leave it at the entrance for that unit, as above. If there is no ATL, you can leave your ‘Attempted Delivery’ card in the unit’s mailbox
at the same entrance.

## PARKING

### Visitor parking

Unfortunately, there is no visitor parking on our property, but two options are:

### Drop-offs and pick-ups

The driveway usually has space for quick drop-offs and pick-ups. Anketell Street is ‘No Stopping’. If Oakden Street’s parking is full, deliverers may have to double-park.

### Loading zones

The driveway has two 30-minute Loading Zones:

We apologise that neither of the other entrances has loading zones. You cannot stop outside the Anketell Street entrance, and you’ll probably have to double park outside the Oakden Street entrance. However, all entrances
are only a short walk from the driveway.
