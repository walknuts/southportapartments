      <h2>DESIGN AND BUILD</h2>
      
      <img src="/images/pages/1-about-007.jpg" alt="Southport building exterior" class="rounded-xl my-6">
      
      <p>Southport was a project of GEOCON, Canberra's largest residential developer and the fifth-largest in Australia. Eight years later, GEOCON still supports us, including supplying information for this website.</p>
      
      <p>Award-winning Cox Architecture developed the concept, which Peckvonhartel then detailed. There are 353 units (all with allocated undercover parking) and three shops. Distinctive are the 'Terrace' units, which have front and rear courtyards on two levels, cross-flow ventilation, and parking at their back doors.</p>
      
      <p>Southport has two buildings:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Stage 1* is the quadrant facing the lake</li>
        <li>Stage 2* is the tower on Anketell Street</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>(*We are considering renaming the buildings more imaginatively and descriptively than the developer's building schedule.)</p>
