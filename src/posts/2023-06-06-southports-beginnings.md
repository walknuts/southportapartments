Interested in our early history?

In 2015, the ACT Government released the 'Southquay Master Plan':

Southport was the first of the apartments in this exciting new development, which the ACT Government modelled on Kingston Foreshore.

The ACT Government approved Southport's development on 6 March 2015. Assisting Geocon with the project were:

- Cox (architect)
- Spacelab (landscape architect)
- Independent Property Group (agent).

Construction continued until late 2017. It wasn't without incident. Canberrans will remember how, in June 2016, heavy rain caused the construction site to collapse. The extensive damage led to closures and weight and
speed restrictions on Anketell Street opposite Bunnings.

The first owners moved in in September 2017.
