Today, the ACT Government told us they have shortlisted Southport's bid to participate in their 'Sustainable Apartments Pilot'. What does that mean?

The ACT Government's Climate Choices website says it 'will provide detailed feasibility studies for the electrification of 7 apartment complexes â€¦ at no cost'. It will mainly consider us moving our hot water from gas to electricity, but it will also consider EV charging.

Having been shortlisted, we are compiling the requested information to proceed to the next stage. We'll keep you posted.
