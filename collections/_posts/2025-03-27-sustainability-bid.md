Today, the ACT Government announced that they have selected Southport to participate in their 'Sustainable Apartments Pilot'. What does that mean?

The ACT Government's Climate Choices website says it 'will provide detailed feasibility studies for the electrification of 7 apartment complexes â€¦ at no cost'. A consultant will soon commence our feasibility study, which will look at moving our hot water from gas to electricity, and EV charging. We'll keep you posted.
