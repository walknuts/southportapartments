Yes, finally, this is it! Thanks for visiting.

Why a website? We want to promote Southport's lifestyle and value publicly by offering helpful information for owners, renters, visitors, buyers, managers and contractors.

Isn't there information already through Grady Strata's portal?

Yes, but we want more than the legislative and contractual documents. We want helpful extras such as user guides, FAQs, moving instructions, safety advice, and quality management.

Second, we want wider availability; Grady's portal is only for owners.

When an owner volunteered to create and run the website for us, for free, we thought it was a rare opportunity worth trying! Especially when the Owners Corporation Network recommends it.

We hope you enjoy looking around our website, which we hope loads quickly for you because it's 'static', needing no processing through a Content Management System.

Please be patient while we fill in the blanks and smooth the rough edges. And please email your corrections and suggestions to our webmaster at:
