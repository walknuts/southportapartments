**## Drop-offs and pick-ups**
  

The driveway usually has space for quick drop-offs and pick-ups. Anketell Street is ‘No Stopping’. If Oakden Street’s parking is full, deliverers may have to double-park. 
  

**## Loading zones**
  

The driveway has two 30-minute Loading Zones:

We apologise that neither of the other entrances has loading zones. You cannot stop outside the Anketell Street entrance, and you’ll probably have to double park outside the Oakden Street entrance. However, all entrances are only a short walk from the driveway.
