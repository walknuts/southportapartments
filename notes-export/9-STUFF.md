Admin for the Executive Committee and Strata Manager (including Building Manager).
  

**## LEGISLATION**
## 


These are the primary ACT Acts, Regulations and standards governing Southport:
## 


* *Unit Titles (Management) Act 2011 (ACT)*
* *Unit Titles (Management) Regulation 2011 (ACT*
* *Unit Titles Act 2001*
* *Land Titles Act 1925*
* *National Construction Code* (NCC, for which Southport’s buildings are Class 2, so Volume 1 applies generally and Volume 3 for plumbing).


## 


**## DEFINITIONS**
### 


Managing Southport involves knowing some special terms, including the following.
  

**### Units plan**
### 


A legal group of units such as Southport Apartments, which is registered as Units Plan No. 4368.
### 


### Developer


**###**
The lessee who applied to develop a units plan on their land. (Adapted from the Unit Titles Act, Dictionary.)
  

Southport’s developer was GEOCON.
  

### Owners corporation


  

‘The owners corporation for a units plan is responsible for managing the units plan’ as (s 7 of the *Unit Titles (Management) Act 2011* explains. s 10 of the Act then explains that ‘The members of an owners corporation for a units plan are the owners of the units’. 
  

Some Australian states use the term ‘body corporate’. 
### 


### Strata


  

‘Strata’ is a units plan’s finances, people and legals. It’s like the *software*.
### 


### Facilities


  

‘Facilities’ are a units plan’s buildings, equipment and systems. It’s like the *hardware*.
  

We plan to improve the organisation of the following elements, ideally into an ISO 9001-approved Quality Manual.
  

### Unit ‘type’


## 


Southport’s units are Class A because ‘the boundary of the unit is defined by floors, walls and ceilings of the unit’ (from ACT Planning’s website).
  

While mainly residential, Southport is what the UTMA (s 39A) calls a ‘mixed-use inputs plan’.
## 


**## STRATA MANAGEMENT**
## 


While s 7 of the UTMA says ‘The owners corporation for a units plan is responsible for managing the units plan’, it also says, ‘An owners corporation may be helped by … a manager’, often called a Strata Manager.
